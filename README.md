# Detecting-Credit-Card-Fraud-machineLearning
Today I did a machine learning project that predicts whether a purchase made with a credit card is legitimate or not. I did an analysis and cleaning of about 285,000 rows of data. After that, I made the data readable for our model and combined it and created a new data set. We used the logistic regression model. Because the logistic regression model is a classification model and we classified whether a credit card purchase is fake or Regal. Finally, in the visual studio code environment, I wrote a site code where you can view your model in your local web environment and make model predictions.
